  /// Conditions In Dart
  /// When you write a computer program, you need to be able to tell the computer what to do in different situations. With conditions, you can control the flow of the dart program. Suppose you need to execute a specific code when a particular situation is true. In that case, you can use conditions in Dart. E.g., a calculator app must perform subtraction if the user presses the subtract button and addition if the user taps the add button
